1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,430
You know, the biggest
issue I think I have,

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,650
and many other people have, 
with Mike Bloomberg

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:08,210
and how he’s defending his
stop and frisk record is that

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,064
he doesn’t seem to know
what he’s defending.

5
00:00:11,064 --> 00:00:13,350
And that, for me, is a problem.

6
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:16,744
You know? He goes, “Oh, 
I apologize for the policy.”

7
00:00:16,744 --> 00:00:20,390
And people are not
as angry about the policy,

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,970
I think, as how 
the policy was targeted.

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,870
Because for so many years,
especially in America,

10
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,240
black people have said, “Hey,

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,550
the police are targeting us
just because we’re black.

12
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,430
They treat us like 
we’re all criminals.

13
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,250
They’re not just trying
to go for criminals.”

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,160
And what would people say?

15
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,080
The people – “Oh, 
you’re overreacting.

16
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,790
Cops are not just gonna
throw you against a wall.

17
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,230
You must’ve done something.”

18
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,840
And I can imagine for a long
time, for many black Americans,

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,203
it must’ve felt like being gaslit.

20
00:00:45,203 --> 00:00:47,070
You know what’s happening to you.

21
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,140
You say what’s happening to you.

22
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,380
And people are like, 
“That’s crazy.”

23
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,470
And I can imagine how for
many white people in America

24
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,883
they’re like, “That is crazy.

25
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:55,180
You just get thrown 
against the wall? Why?

26
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,240
You must’ve been 
doing something.”

27
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,410
’Cause white people are like, 
“I’ve never been thrown

28
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,960
against a wall. That
would never happen to me.

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,120
What, what, you just get thrown
against the wall? That’s it?

30
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,110
I see cops all the time.

31
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,630
I say, ‘Hello, officer,’ 
they say, ‘Hello, sir,’

32
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,723
and then I keep walking.

33
00:01:04,723 --> 00:01:06,560
You just get thrown 
against the wall?

34
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,680
That doesn’t make any sense.”

35
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,500
And then a lot
of black people are like, 

36
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,730
“You white people are being
racist ’cause you don’t...”

37
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,430
And white people are like, 
“That is insane.

38
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,500
Cops will not just throw...”

39
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,680
And I can see how people
have lived in these worlds

40
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,513
for so long.

41
00:01:16,513 --> 00:01:18,800
And then now you have audio
of Mike Bloomberg saying...

42
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,061
And that audio, for me, if you
break it down into pieces,

43
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:22,510
has so many issues with it.

44
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:25,923
First of all, the fact that he
says if you look at criminals

45
00:01:25,923 --> 00:01:29,200
and victims of crime, et cetera, 
you can xerox –

46
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,910
you can just copy and paste
it and put it out there.

47
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,510
It shows me that you
didn’t even care about

48
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,050
the differences 
between black people.

49
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,700
You made it seem 
like black is crime

50
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,982
when, in fact, black is
most affected by crime.

51
00:01:38,982 --> 00:01:40,970
That is the thing 
that you did there.

52
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,210
Alright? That’s the first 
problem I have.

53
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,620
Secondly, the fact that
people don’t seem to realize

54
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:49,070
the ramifications of
treating people like that.

55
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,270
Imagine if you are 
a black kid living in

56
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,363
Mike Bloomberg’s New York City.

57
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:57,670
Every day you’re getting frisked
and thrown against a wall.

58
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,503
Huh?

59
00:01:58,503 --> 00:01:59,336
Put over the hood of a car.

60
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:01,027
Every day this is what cops
are just – this is your life.

61
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:04,290
Now imagine if you are a black
kid who lives in this world.

62
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,240
A cop gets you, pulls you,
throws you into a wall.

63
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,430
“You got something?” 
“No.”

64
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,930
You carry on. 
Next day it happens again.

65
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,438
Maybe next week, maybe
next month, whenever it is.

66
00:02:10,438 --> 00:02:13,540
At some point, what do
you say? Fuck the police.

67
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,220
Alright? And then you
get people like, “Why don’t

68
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,053
you respect the police?”

69
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,180
Why don’t they respect me?

70
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,160
They don’t protect and serve me.

71
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,580
These people come and
throw me against the wall

72
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,077
and treat me like a criminal.

73
00:02:21,077 --> 00:02:22,398
You know what I mean?

74
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:24,230
And then what does 
that kid do one day?

75
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,520
They see the cops, 
they go, “Screw this.

76
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,510
I’m not staying around for this.”

77
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,343
They run away.

78
00:02:27,343 --> 00:02:28,260
The cops pursue.

79
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,590
Now they catch you. 
What are you –

80
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,860
you’re evading arrest,
you’re resisting arrest.

81
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,977
Now you get arrested for 
resisting arrest.

82
00:02:33,977 --> 00:02:36,050
Then you go to jail.
You can’t afford bail.

83
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:36,883
Now you’re in prison.

84
00:02:36,883 --> 00:02:38,701
What does prison turn you
into more likely than not?

85
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,380
A criminal. Alright?

86
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,470
And even if you don’t become
a criminal because of that,

87
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,020
you are still in the system now.

88
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:45,590
We’ve seen how these kids 
get locked up.

89
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,850
They can’t afford to come out.

90
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,100
Now they are living 
a life of crime

91
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,459
without being a criminal.

92
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:52,230
And then you’re just
like, “Oh, but these kids

93
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,210
spend all their time in jail.”

94
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,600
How did they get to jail?

95
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,760
“Why were you running from the cops?”

96
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,830
“Because I was tired of 
being thrown

97
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,439
against the motherfucking wall.”

98
00:02:58,439 --> 00:02:59,624
I’m not gonna stick around for that.

99
00:02:59,624 --> 00:03:01,610
I remember that in high school.

100
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,421
I didn’t wait. The bully
came, and I was like, “Oh, shit,”

101
00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:05,590
and I was gone.

102
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,000
I wasn’t gonna stand
there and be like, “Yeah,

103
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,624
well, good afternoon, bully.
Nice to see you again.

104
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:11,150
Different thing today, yes?

105
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,130
Are we gonna talk this out?”

106
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,830
No, at some point you knew
the bully was gonna do

107
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,330
what he was gonna do, so you ran
before they even got to you.

108
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,890
And then people are like, “Why
are these kids running away?

109
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,980
They don’t respect the police.”

110
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,650
But do the police respect them?

111
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,650
And that is something 
no one can deny.

112
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:25,580
If you’ve ever been in a rich
neighborhood specifically,

113
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,257
not just a white neighborhood,

114
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:28,090
but a rich neighborhood,

115
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,650
you will see the
relationship that police have

116
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,483
with those communities.

117
00:03:30,483 --> 00:03:31,710
It’s very different.

118
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,950
Because they know if they
throw the wrong person,

119
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,840
search the wrong person,
frisk the wrong person,

120
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,920
that person knows someone
powerful enough to make sure

121
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,890
that their job is in danger.

122
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,500
And those are the dynamics
that you’re dealing with. 

123
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,630
So my problem with Mike
Bloomberg is he’s not saying,

124
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,600
“I’m sorry for targeting 
black people.

125
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,010
I’m sorry for treating 
black people like

126
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,590
second-class citizens.
I’m sorry for gaslighting

127
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,423
black people for so long.”

128
00:03:50,423 --> 00:03:53,121
No, he’s just like, “I’m sorry
that stop and frisk happened

129
00:03:53,121 --> 00:03:55,017
to affect black communities.”

130
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:56,839
And it’s like, no, 
it didn’t happen to.

131
00:03:56,839 --> 00:04:01,763
You designed it to.

132
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:04,346
